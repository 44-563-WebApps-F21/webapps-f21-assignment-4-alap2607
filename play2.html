<h6 class="hunstanton"> HUNSTANTON.</h6><p class="name"> Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I
suppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new
duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a
pleasant cigarette.</p><br>

<h6 class="illingworth"> ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="name"> I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady
Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.</p><br>

<h6 class="ladyhunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6><p class="name">I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I
suppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,
when you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are
going to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!
dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.
ARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord
Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant
way in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They
sit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?</p><br>

<h6 class="arbuthnot">MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</h6><p class="name">I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.</p><br>

<h6 class="ladyhunstanton" >LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> <p class="name">Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?</p><br>

<h6 class="archdeacon">THE ARCHDEACON.</h6><p class="name">She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.
But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched
the tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other
amusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.</p><br>

<h6 class="ladyhunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6><p class="name">Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,
what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.</p><br>

<h6 class="illingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="name"> I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the
world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in
which it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever
the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.</p><br>

<h6 class="ladyhustanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6><p class="name"> Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord
Illingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.
They never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord
Illingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I
always try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.
And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.</p><br>
