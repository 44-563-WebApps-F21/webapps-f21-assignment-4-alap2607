            <p>LADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
                name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
                man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.<br>
                
                HESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.<br>
                
                LADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
                yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
                invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
                Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
                was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
                believe she ran away more than once.<br>
                
                HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.<br>
                
                LADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
                Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
                have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
                right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
                one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
                considered the thing.<br>
                
                HESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.<br>
                
                LADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.<br>
                
                HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so
                sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
                across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.<br>
                
                LADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
                lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
                English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They
                show them then.<br></p>
