            <p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
knew she would come round in the end.<br></p>

<p><h6>GERALD.</h6>  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.<br></p>

<p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.<br></p>

<p><h6>GERALD.</h6>  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.<br></p>

<p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
the community.<br></p>

<p><h6>GERALD.</h6>  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?<br></p>

<p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.<br></p>

<p><h6>GERALD.</h6>  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.<br></p>

<p><h6>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  So Lady Hunstanton told me.<br></p>
