            <p class="stage">[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>

<h6 class="LordIllingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p>Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
knew she would come round in the end.</p>

<h6 class="Gerald">GERALD.</h6> <p> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>

<h6 class="LordIllingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p> My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>

<h6 class="Gerald">GERALD.</h6><p>  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>

    <h6 class="LordIllingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p> Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
the community.</p>

<h6 class="Gerald">>GERALD.</h6><p>  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>

    <h6 class="LordIllingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p> I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>

        <h6 class="Gerald">GERALD.</h6>  <p>I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>

            <h6 class="LordIllingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p> So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>
